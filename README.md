# LabVIEW Scripting UI Library
This LabVIEW library can be used to add a text-based scripting UI to your next project. 
The UI consists of an augmented string control that contains some basic features of text-based IDEs, such as line numbers, markers, and autocompletion.  All of the business logic is handled asynchronously in the background, so that developers can make use of a simple API, powerful properties, and custom events to quickly add functionality to existing applications. Like an XControl... but without the myriad headaches of XControls.

More info to come.

**Note:** This library does not provide any native support for parsing script text or executing commands! 
By decoupling the UI from the scripting backend, you can integrate it with any custom syntax you may need
