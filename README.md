# LabVIEW Scripting UI Library

This LabVIEW library can be used to add a text-based scripting UI to your next project.
The UI consists of an augmented string control that contains some basic features of text-based IDEs, such as line numbers, markers, and autocompletion.
There are also advanced properties and custom events to facilitate integrating the UI into an application.

More info to come.

**Note:** This library is just a UI! It does not provide any native support for parsing script text or executing commands. 
By decoupling the UI from the scripting backend, you can integrate it with any custom syntax you may need.
